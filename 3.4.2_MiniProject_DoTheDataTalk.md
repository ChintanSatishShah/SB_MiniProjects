# **Questions on Data Landscape**

**Master data**

How and where do you store configuration data and master data? Have you implemented any MDM module? Where and how is user auth data stored?

**Transaction data**

How and where do you store transaction data? What is the typical size and velocity of data? How do you manage archival and purging of data?

**System Data**

What additional data is generated as part of the current IT infrastructure? e.g. Message Queues, Logs, Spreadsheets, Images, Videos, Docs etc. Where is it currently stored and archived?

**Reporting Data**

Is the data stored separately for reporting purpose? How do you move data to reporting data store?

**3rd party data source**

Do you rely on any 3rd party data source for master or standard data (e.g. RSS feeds / Web scraping / Access to data store etc.)? If yes, how do you get the data? Are necessary agreements in place?

**3rd party API calls**

What is the request-response structures for 3rd party APIs? Is any critical data being sent is request? Is the critical data encrypted? Are their necessary agreements related to sharing of data and its usage terms?

**APIs shared with 3rd parties**

What is the request-response structures for APIs? Is any critical data being sent in response? Is the critical data encrypted? Are their necessary agreements related to sharing of data and its usage terms?

**Storage**

Is the data stored on cloud or on-premise? What is the hardware and software BOM? Are there necessary agreements in place for cloud storage? Who/which team is the primary owner of on-premise data storage?

**Data flow**

What is the data flow pipeline for various processes? How is the authentication, masking, encryption and data access managed at each step of pipeline? Which systems/components have a direct integration with end-state data storage?

**Redundant data**

Are there any scenarios where redundant data is stored across different units or parts of organization? If so, what is the business need for the same? What is the source of truth?

**Access Control**

Who is the owner of each of the above listed data ? With whom is the data shared? Is the required access control implemented for direct access / passive access via IT applications and APIs?

**Security**

Is there any PII type data being stored – either of customers or employees or 3rd party? If so, are necessary security measures being adopted e.g. Encryption of data at rest / in transit?

How secure are data stores? Is appropriate authentication applied for APIs?

**Scalability**

Is the data storage scalable? Is adequate capacity planning done to ensure the near- and long-term storage requirements will be met? What are the best practices in place to ensure optimal usage of storage and processing resources?

**Reliability and Disaster Recovery**

Which of the above-mentioned data requires backup plan? Is data replication implemented? Which of the above listed data needs disaster recovery plan? What is the DR strategy?

**Dark data**

How do you deal with data in emails, docs, audio files, images, videos etc. which are managed and maintained by the organization? What precautions are taken to avoid leakage of confidential data?

**Social data**

What practices are in place for data shared on social media platforms? How do you manage the associated likes, comments etc.?

**Data Strategy**

How do you plan to use the above-mentioned data beyond its current usage paradigm? What are the strategies to better utilize the available data? Is there any plan to extend the breadth and depth of data capture?
